    "questionText": "In some of his sculptures, Allan Houser uses abstract geometric shapes to depict his subjects rather than portraying them in realistic detail.

Meanwhile, Patricia J. Wittkopp and colleagues have investigated how convergence occurs through different genetic mechanisms, but the relative prevalence of convergence through shared and different genetic processes is still poorly understood.

Occasionally I was ready for them: very often I wasn't. Never, however, was I so aware of entering a new stage as I was that afternoon in October when I finally dared to cross the threshold and my steps sounded hollowly in the unfurnished apartment.

    "questionText": "In Brazil, use of solid fuel (e.g., coal, wood) as a share of total household fuel use fell by around 70 percent between 2000 and 2019; such shifts are typically explained by appeal to the energy ladder, a model holding that fuel choice is mediated mainly by household income (specifically, high-technology fuels displace solid fuels as incomes rise). Alemu Mekonnen and Gunnar Kohlin's study of fuel use in Ethiopia shows this model to be reductive, however: household fuel use was heterogeneous, flexible, and influenced by several factors, including households' cooking habits.",

      "Between 2000 and 2019, household incomes rose in Brazil. resulting in households meeting a greater proportion of their fuel needs with high-technology fuels.",

      "Solid fuel use declined in Brazil between 2000 and 2019 because changes in household income during that period made solid fuels more expensive relative to income.",

    "questionText": "Chesapeake Bay seagrass meadows constitute crucial habitats for many aquatic species. Historically, eelgrass has been predominant, but widgeon grass is proving better suited torecent increases in sea temperature, tolerating heat better and growing faster than eelgrass does. Although the increase in widgeon grass has been associated with a substantial increase in total seagrass coverage in the bay, researchers caution that the latter change does not necessarily make the seagrass ecosystem as a whole more resilient to environmental shocks.",
    "prompt": "Which statement, if true, would account for data shown in the graph and would illustrate the point made by the researchers?",
    "choices": [
      "In early 2019, unusually heavy rains washed excessive nutrients into the bay, leading to algal blooms that prevented sunlight from reaching many seagrass species.",
      "In early 2018, a fungal infection that affects widgeon grass and eelgrass but does not affect other types of seagrass spread through the bay.",
      "Between 2012 and 2017, the total area covered by widgeon grass and the total area covered by all types of seagrass increased as water temperatures in the bay increased.",
      "Water temperatures in the bay increased slowly from 2012 to 2018. but in early 2019 there was an unprecedently large increase in temperatures, which reached levels that can be tolerated by few seagrass species other than widgeon grass."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "This statement explains why increased total coverage doesn't mean greater resilience: a sudden temperature spike could devastate the ecosystem, leaving only widgeon grass, which illustrates the researchers' caution.",

Other studies track annual round-trip distance (RTD) which is equal to double the distance separating the two habitats a population migrates between each year.

Although efficiencies in long-distance transport of parcels have greatly improved delivery times, last-mile logistics (the final step in deliver to consumers) present a bottleneck for delivery companies. Time pressure resulting from consumer expectations is not the only challenge: other obstacles, such as the increasing congestion of roadways, persist.

The bacteria form a dense biofilm on the surface of an electron-collecting anode, but moving the electrons from the bacterial cytoplasm to an external electrode requires that the electrons pass through a series of inefficient oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. Accordingly, MFC power output rarely exceeds a density of 0.30 miliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2). In an experiment, researchers added silver nanoparticles to carbon paper covering the anode in an MFC. The resulting power density was 0.66 mW/cm2. Since metals such as silver exhibit high electrical conductivity, the researchers hypothesized that ______",

For Titan, Saturn's largest moon, the observational data that exist are too sparse and discrepant to fully constrain the range of the methane mole fraction at various atmospheric levels. Juan Lora and colleagues point out that outputs of the IPSL atmospheric model of Titan, which track closely to observations in some respects reflect how the model's developers responded to this challenge: by prescribing a uniform methane mole fraction for the lowest level of the atmosphere.

Fodor hypothesized that low-level cognitive systems (e.g., perception, language) are modular.\n- In Fodorian modularity, high-level systems (e.g., reasoning) are not modular\n- 2003: cognitive scientist Peter Carruthers proposed the massive modularity hypothesis (MMH)\n- MMH expands modularity to include all cognitive systems\nThe student wants to compare Fodor's hypothesis with Carruthers's.",

      "In 2003, Carruthers proposed the massive modularity hypothesis, disagreeing with Fodor's earlier hypothesis that the mind is composed of innate neural structures.",

I was supposed to memorize the whole thing, playing the repeat parts twice to make the piece sound longer. But I dawdled over it, playing a few bars and then cheating, looking up to see what notes followed. I never really listened to what I was playing.

Text 1 To Margaret the station of king's Cross had always suggested infinity. Its very situation --- withdrawn a little behind the facile splendors of St. Pancras --- implied a comment on the materialism of life. Those two great arches, colorless, indifferent, shouldering between them an unlovely clock, were fit portals for some eternal adventure, whose issue might be prosperous, but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary language of prosperity. Text 2 The interplay between opposing ideological positions in Howards End is broadly articulated in the novel's organization of geographic space. On the one hand, the modern metropolis of London represents capitalism’s emphasis on pragmatism and the accumulation of material wealth; on the other, the English countryside, accessible via King's Cross, fosters an idealism that values tradition, authentic personal connection, and the aesthetic --- what the novel calls \"the infinite.

    "questionText": "Born in Chile in 1917, artist and ethnomusicologist Violeta Parra was a pioneer in the nueva canción Chilean (Chilean New Song) movement that emerged in the late 1950s and then spread throughout Latin America, Portugal, and Spain as nueva canción. Parra traveled all over Chile compiling extensive records of authentic folk music as well as recipes, proverbs, and other facets of cultural history. These records formed the foundation for the early movement's revival of traditional Chilean folk forms in new songs that represented modern realities of the working class and strongly advocated for social change. As the movement spread beyond Chile, the breadth of musical traditions incorporated into its foundation also expanded. Which detail about songs associated with nueva canción, if true, would best illustrate the underlined claim?",

    "questionText": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) capitalize on the ability of some species of bacteria to metabolize metal, liberating electrons. The bacteria form a dense biofilm on the surface of an electron-collecting anode, but moving the electrons from the bacterial cytoplasm to an external electrode requires that the electrons pass through a series of inefficient oxidation --- reduction (redox) reacuons. Accordingly, MFC power output rarely exceeds a density of 0.30 milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm ). In an experiment, researchers added silver nanoparticles to carbon paper covering the anode in an MFC. The resulting power density was 0,66 mw/cm .
