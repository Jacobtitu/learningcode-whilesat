## ✅ SOLVED (15 questions)

| Q# | Answer | Solution |
|----|--------|----------|
| 1 | **A** | 20% of 310 = 62 |
| 4 | **B** | Discriminant analysis: a > 15.5, smallest integer = 16 |
| 5 | **D** | Area = 8 × 58 = 464 cm² |
| 6 | **A** | Infinite solutions means k = 27 |
| 7 | **A** | Point (1.0, 3.9) means at 1.0 sec, height is 3.9 m |
| 8 | **A** | y-intercept: f(0) = -1/4, so point is (0, -1/4) |
| 9 | **C** | Smallest std dev = most consecutive: 73,74,75,76,77 |
| 12 | **B** | P(C) = 1 - 0.68 - 0.24 = 0.08, visitors = 275 × 0.08 = 22 |

| 14 | **D** | f(x) = -10(2)^(x/3) matches table D |
| 15 | **B** | In right triangle: cos(S) = sin(R) = 3√17/13 |
| 18 | **C** | -(5/12)π × (180°/π) = -(5/12)π(180°/π) |
| 19 | **D** | 24% decrease = 76% remains: M = 100(0.76)^(t/22.96) |
| 20 | **D** | Sum of roots = -b/a = 30 |
| 22 | **C** | f(-2) - f(0) = 421 - 53 = 368 |

## 📝 SOLUTIONS EXPLAINED

### Q4: System with no real solutions
- Given: y = -0.5 and y = x² + 8x + a
- Substitute: x² + 8x + (a + 0.5) = 0
- No real solutions when discriminant < 0
- 64 - 4(a + 0.5) < 0 → a > 15.5
- **Answer: B (16)** - smallest positive integer

### Q16: Function composition
- m(3) = 5(3) + 3 = 18
- p(3) = 3 - 3 = 0
- 2m(3) - p(3) = 36
- **Check which choice = 36**

### Q17: Tablets with tax
- Price per tablet with 7% tax: $170 × 1.07 = $181.90
- Maximum tablets: $3400 ÷ $181.90 = 18.69
- **Answer: 18 tablets** (check choice letter)

### Q21: Triangle with parallel lines
- Sum of angles: 39 + x + (5x - 3) = 180
- Solve: x = 24°
- Angle T = 5(24) - 3 = 117°
- With LK || RT, angle SKL = 117° (corresponding angles)
- **Check which choice = 117°**

### Q22: Quadratic function
- Vertex form: f(x) = a(x - 1)² + 7
- Using (2,53): a = 46
- f(x) = 46(x - 1)² + 7
- f(-2) = 421, f(0) = 53
- **Answer: C (368)**
