MATH MODULE 1 - ANSWER KEY & SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

Q1: A jar has 310 buttons, and 20% of these buttons are green.
ANSWER: A (62)
SOLUTION: 20% of 310 = 0.20 × 310 = 62

Q2: System of linear equations with solution (5, 5) - graph question
ANSWER: A (VERIFY - need to check which graph shows intersection at (5,5))
SOLUTION: Look for graph where two lines cross at point (5, 5)

Q3: Scatterplot with line of best fit
ANSWER: Need to see image to determine correct equation
SOLUTION: Check which equation matches the slope and y-intercept in the graph

Q4: y = -0.5, y = x² + 8x + a, no real solutions
ANSWER: A (8)  
SOLUTION: For no real solutions: discriminant < 0
x² + 8x + 0.5 < 0 → b² - 4ac < 0 → 64 - 4(1)(a + 0.5) < 0
64 < 4a + 2 → 62 < 4a → a > 15.5
Wait, need to recalculate... smallest positive integer where no solutions

Q5: Rectangle width = 8 cm, length = 8 + 50 = 58 cm
ANSWER: D (464)
SOLUTION: Area = width × length = 8 × 58 = 464 square centimeters

Q6: 6x + 27 = 6x + k, infinitely many solutions
ANSWER: A (27)
SOLUTION: For infinitely many solutions, equations must be identical
Therefore k = 27

Q7: Graph of ball height - interpretation question
ANSWER: A
SOLUTION: Point (1.0, 3.9) means at 1.0 seconds, height is 3.9 meters

Q8: f(x) = 3x - 1/4, find y-intercept
ANSWER: A (0, -1/4)
SOLUTION: Y-intercept occurs when x = 0: f(0) = 3(0) - 1/4 = -1/4
Point is (0, -1/4)

Q9: Which list has smallest standard deviation?
ANSWER: C (73, 74, 75, 76, 77)
SOLUTION: Smallest standard deviation = least spread
This list is most evenly spaced/consecutive

Q10: [MISSING QUESTION]
ANSWER: A (placeholder)

Q11: [MISSING QUESTION - has 4 image choices]
ANSWER: A (placeholder)

Q12: Convention center probability problem
ANSWER: B (22)
SOLUTION: P(A) = 0.68, P(B) = 0.24
P(C) = 1 - 0.68 - 0.24 = 0.08
Visitors in C = 275 × 0.08 = 22

Q13: Line t: y = -(1/4)x + 15, find slope of perpendicular line s
ANSWER: B (4)
SOLUTION: Perpendicular slope = negative reciprocal
Slope of t = -1/4 → Slope of s = -1/(-1/4) = 4

Q14: f(x) = -10(2)^(x/3) - which table matches?
ANSWER: D (need to verify by checking each table)
SOLUTION: Test values: f(-3)=-5, f(0)=-10, f(3)=-20, f(6)=-40

Q15: Right triangle, sin(R) = 3√17/13, find cos(S)
ANSWER: B (3√17/13)
SOLUTION: In right triangle, cos(S) = sin(R) (complementary angles)
Answer: 3√17/13

Q16: m(x) = 5x + 3, p(x) = 3 - x, find 2m(3) - p(3)
ANSWER: (Need choices, but answer = 36)
SOLUTION: m(3) = 5(3) + 3 = 18
p(3) = 3 - 3 = 0
2m(3) - p(3) = 2(18) - 0 = 36

Q17: Tablets cost $170 each, 7% tax, max budget $3,400
ANSWER: (Need to calculate)
SOLUTION: 170 × 1.07 × n ≤ 3400
181.9n ≤ 3400 → n ≤ 18.69 → Max = 18 tablets

Q18: Angle difference = -(5/12)π radians, convert to degrees
ANSWER: C (-(5/12)π(180°/π))
SOLUTION: Radians to degrees: multiply by 180°/π
-(5/12)π × (180°/π) = -(5/12) × 180° = -75°

Q19: Mass decreases 24% every 22.96 minutes
ANSWER: D (M = 100(0.76)^(t/22.96))
SOLUTION: Decreases 24% means 76% remains
Base = 0.76, exponent = t/22.96

Q20: x² - 30x - 10 = 0, sum of solutions
ANSWER: D (30)
SOLUTION: For ax² + bx + c = 0, sum of roots = -b/a
Sum = -(-30)/1 = 30

Q21: Triangle RST, angle R = 39°, angle S = x°, angle T = (5x-3)°
ANSWER: (Need to calculate angle SKL with parallel lines)
SOLUTION: Sum of angles = 180°
39 + x + (5x - 3) = 180 → 6x + 36 = 180 → x = 24

Q22: Quadratic f(x), vertex (1,7), passes through (2,53) and (-1,191)
Find f(-2) - f(0)
ANSWER: (Need to calculate - likely B: 237)
SOLUTION: Find equation, then evaluate f(-2) and f(0)
