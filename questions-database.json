Occasionally I was ready for them: very often I wasn't. Never, however, was I so aware of entering a new stage as I was that afternoon in October when I finally dared to cross the threshold and my steps sounded hollowly in the unfurnished apartment.

    "questionText": "In Brazil, use of solid fuel (e.g., coal, wood) as a share of total household fuel use fell by around 70 percent between 2000 and 2019; such shifts are typically explained by appeal to the energy ladder, a model holding that fuel choice is mediated mainly by household income (specifically, high-technology fuels displace solid fuels as incomes rise). Alemu Mekonnen and Gunnar Kohlin's study of fuel use in Ethiopia shows this model to be reductive, however: household fuel use was heterogeneous, flexible, and influenced by several factors, including households' cooking habits.",

      "Between 2000 and 2019, household incomes rose in Brazil. resulting in households meeting a greater proportion of their fuel needs with high-technology fuels.",

Utilizing the Index of Waterbird Community Integrity (IWCl), on which a high score corresponds to high community integrity, the researchers found that bulkheads are more strongly negatively correlated with waterbird community integrity than is riprap.",
    "prompt": "Which finding, if true, would most directly illustrate the researchers' finding?",
    "choices": [
      "Waterbird communities at Curtis, a site with a high percentage of shoreline consisting of bulkheads and riprap, had lower average IWCI scores than did waterbird communities at Onancock, a site with a low percentage of shoreline consisting of bulkheads and riprap.",

    "questionText": "Chesapeake Bay seagrass meadows constitute crucial habitats for many aquatic species. Historically, eelgrass has been predominant, but widgeon grass is proving better suited torecent increases in sea temperature, tolerating heat better and growing faster than eelgrass does. Although the increase in widgeon grass has been associated with a substantial increase in total seagrass coverage in the bay, researchers caution that the latter change does not necessarily make the seagrass ecosystem as a whole more resilient to environmental shocks.",
    "prompt": "Which statement, if true, would account for data shown in the graph and would illustrate the point made by the researchers?",
    "choices": [
      "In early 2019, unusually heavy rains washed excessive nutrients into the bay, leading to algal blooms that prevented sunlight from reaching many seagrass species.",
      "In early 2018, a fungal infection that affects widgeon grass and eelgrass but does not affect other types of seagrass spread through the bay.",
      "Between 2012 and 2017, the total area covered by widgeon grass and the total area covered by all types of seagrass increased as water temperatures in the bay increased.",
      "Water temperatures in the bay increased slowly from 2012 to 2018. but in early 2019 there was an unprecedently large increase in temperatures, which reached levels that can be tolerated by few seagrass species other than widgeon grass."

Although efficiencies in long-distance transport of parcels have greatly improved delivery times, last-mile logistics (the final step in deliver to consumers) present a bottleneck for delivery companies. Time pressure resulting from consumer expectations is not the only challenge: other obstacles, such as the increasing congestion of roadways, persist.

    "questionText": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) capitalize on the ability of some species of bacteria to metabolize metal, liberating electrons. The bacteria form a dense biofilm on the surface of an electron-collecting anode, but moving the electrons from the bacterial cytoplasm to an external electrode requires that the electrons pass through a series of inefficient oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. Accordingly, MFC power output rarely exceeds a density of 0.30 miliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2). In an experiment, researchers added silver nanoparticles to carbon paper covering the anode in an MFC. The resulting power density was 0.66 mW/cm2. Since metals such as silver exhibit high electrical conductivity, the researchers hypothesized that ______",

For Titan, Saturn's largest moon, the observational data that exist are too sparse and discrepant to fully constrain the range of the methane mole fraction at various atmospheric levels.

They examined settlements in urban systems across Western Europe, with groupings based on regionally distinct political structures, economic focuses, and spatial constraints --- including the aristocratically controlled city-state of Parma in northern Italy, merchant controlled city-states like Goerlitz in Germany, the wool-trading centers of Lincoln and Canterbury in England, and prime trade fair towns like Troyes in France. A prevalent trend emerged: as a city's total settled area increased, so did population density in its core urban areas.

Over the last century, baleen whale populations have declined, and contrary to some scientists' expectations, so have krill populations. Matthew $.

    "questionText": "Michelle Pereira et al. hypothesized that introducing health improvements into workplaces would increase productivity by reducing, absenteeism (sick employees not working) and presenteeism (sick workers working less productively due to illness). Pereira's team enrolled groups of Australian workers in two programs: one that gave employees exercise training (EET) and one that enrolled employees in health promotion seminars (EHP). They then calculated the productivity loss of those groups at 12 weeks and 12 months after the programs began (based on the 28 days preceding each point). They concluded that exercise training was more effective at restraining productivity loss than health promotion seminars were, though this result took time to become apparent. Which choice best describes data from the table that most effectively strengthen Perelra and colleagues' conclusion?",

    "questionText": "Ningyo joruri is a form of theater that was popular in eighteenth-century Japan and that unites puppetry with playing of the shamisen, a stringed musical instrument. The popularity of ningyo joruri was due to a puppetry method called sannin zukai, in which three puppeteers operated a single puppet that was large, detailed, and capable of extensive movement and nuanced emotional expression. Over the ensuing centuries, audience interest in ningyo joruri began to decline and saumi zuke became prohibitively expensive to mount, so that sannin zukai puppeteers could no longer make the profession a full time career. Eventually, ningyo joruri productions resorted to cheaper forms of puppetry, such as kurznna ningyo, which involves only one puppeteer Which statement, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence?",

Rachel Mugge and colleagues were particularly curious about the effects of wooden shipwrecks on seafloor microbial communities. The researchers studied two wooden shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico by placing pieces of pine and oak between zero and 200 meters away from each shipwreck to collect samples of three kinds of microbes: bacteria, archaea, and fungi. They found that across the three microbial communities, peak diversity and richness was observed on pine and oak samples placed approximately 125 meters from the shipwrecks.

Computer models have determined that for potential hycean planets, the range of the habitable zone(HZ), the distance from a star that allows a planet to retain liquid water on its surface, begins at about 1 astronomical unit (AU). In 2021, Nikku Madhusudhan et al. identified K2-18 b as a hycean candidate, noting that the planet is located right on the inner edge of the HZ. Text 2 In a 2023 paper, Shang-Min Tsai et al. claimed that the hydrogen-rich atmospheres of K2-18b and other hycean candidates admit wavelengths of light that cause elevated surface temperatures and increased water evaporation. Unlike earlier assessments, Tsal et al.'s calculations therefore placed the inner edge for these planets' Z as far out as 3.85 AU. Based on the texts, how would Tsal et al.

Rachel Moseley and colleagues were particularly curious about the effects of wooden shipwrecks on seafloor microbial communities. The researchers studied two wooden shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico by placing pieces of pine and oak between zero and 200 meters away from each shipwreck to collect samples of three kinds of microbes: bacteria, archaea, and fungi. They found that across the three microbial communities, peak diversity and richness was observed on pine and oak samples placed approximately 125 meters from the shipwrecks.

King's Cross and St, Pancras are adjacent railway terminals in London from which trains travel to the countryside. Text 1 To Margaret the station of King's Cross had always suggested Infinity. Its very situation withdrawn a little behind the facile splendours of St, Pancras --- implied a comment on the materialism of life. Those two great arches, colourless, indifferent, shouldering between them an unlovely clock, were fit portals for some eternal adventure, whose issue might be prosperous, but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary language of prosperity. Text 2 The interplay between opposing ideological positions in Howards End is broadly articulated in the novel's organization of geographic space. On the one hand, the modern metropolis of London represents capitalism's emphasis on pragmatism and the accumulation of material wealth; on the other, the English countryside, accessible via King's Cross, fosters an idealism that values tradition, authentic personal connection, and the aesthetic --- what the novel calls \"the infinite.\" Based on the texts, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about King's Cross, as it is depicted in Text 1?",
