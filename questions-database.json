But scientists still have a lot to learn about them. Unlike their ancient ground-dwelling relations, today's sloths spend most of their time high up in trees. The sloths\u2019 inaccessibility has made it hard for scientists to study them. Text 2 By using a hat-like monitor, biologist Bryson Voirin and colleagues can at last discover the previously hidden activities of sloths. Such monitors can provide information to correct misconceptions. It was long believed that sloths sleep all day. But, in fact, in the wild sloths sleep about nine hours a day. The author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 both discuss which topic?",

    "questionText": "Baleen whales eat up to 30 percent of their total body mass in krill (tiny shrimplike creatures) per day. So in one day, a pygmy right whale weighing 3,500 kg could eat 1,050 kg, while a bowhead whale weighing 66,000 kg could ingest a whopping 19,800 kg. Over the last century, baleen whale populations have declined, and contrary to some scientists' expectations, so have krill populations. Matthew $. Savoca and colleagues resolve this apparent discrepancy by pointing out that baleen whales cycle iron in the ocean, helping support phytoplankton populations, which, in turn, sustain krill populations. Based on the text, what can most reasonably be concluded about pygmy right and bowhead whales?",

Ekvall and colleagues found that WC-NPs can accumulate in the bodies of water lice (Asellus aquaticus). While bioaccumulation of manufactured nanoparticles may be inherently worrisome, it has been hypothesized that WC-NP bioaccumulation in invertebrates like A, aquaticus could serve a valuable proxy role, obviating the need for manufacturers to conduct costly and intrusive sampling of vertebrate species --- such as Perez's frogs (Pelophylax perezi), commonly used in regulatory compliance testing --- for nanoparticle bioaccumulation, as environmental protection laws currently require.

Over the ensuing centuries, audience interest in ningyo joruri began to decline and saumi zuke became prohibitively expensive to mount, so that sannin zukai puppeteers could no longer make the profession a full time career.

But culture indefatigably tries. Not to make what each raw person may like, the rule by which he fashions himself; but to draw ever nearer to a sense of what is indeed beautiful, graceful, and becoming, and to get the raw person to like that.

    "questionText": "Text 1 Hycean planets are a class of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) with oceans of liquid water --- critical to supporting life --- and atmospheres rich in hydrogen. Computer models have determined that for potential hycean planets, the range of the habitable zone(HZ), the distance from a star that allows a planet to retain liquid water on its surface, begins at about 1 astronomical unit (AU). In 2021, Nikku Madhusudhan et al. identified K2-18 b as a hycean candidate, noting that the planet is located right on the inner edge of the HZ. Text 2 In a 2023 paper, Shang-Min Tsai et al. claimed that the hydrogen-rich atmospheres of K2-18b and other hycean candidates admit wavelengths of light that cause elevated surface temperatures and increased water evaporation. Unlike earlier assessments, Tsal et al.'s calculations therefore placed the inner edge for these planets' Z as far out as 3.85 AU. Based on the texts, how would Tsal et al. (Text 2) most likely respond to Madhusudhan et al.'s research, as presented in Text 1?",

Parra traveled all over Chile compiling extensive records of authentic folk music as well as recipes, proverbs, and other facets of cultural history. These records formed the foundation for the early movement's revival of traditional Chilean folk forms in new songs that represented modern realities of the working class and strongly advocated for social change.

    "questionText": "The Darlington is just one of approximately three million known historical shipwrecks spread throughout the world's oceans, and their impact on sea life and underwater ecosystems is of great interest to researchers. Rachel Moseley and colleagues were particularly curious about the effects of wooden shipwrecks on seafloor microbial communities. The researchers studied two wooden shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico by placing pieces of pine and oak between zero and 200 meters away from each shipwreck to collect samples of three kinds of microbes: bacteria, archaea, and fungi. They found that across the three microbial communities, peak diversity and richness was observed on pine and oak samples placed approximately 125 meters from the shipwrecks.

King's Cross and St, Pancras are adjacent railway terminals in London from which trains travel to the countryside. Text 1 To Margaret the station of King's Cross had always suggested Infinity. Its very situation withdrawn a little behind the facile splendours of St, Pancras --- implied a comment on the materialism of life. Those two great arches, colourless, indifferent, shouldering between them an unlovely clock, were fit portals for some eternal adventure, whose issue might be prosperous, but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary language of prosperity. Text 2 The interplay between opposing ideological positions in Howards End is broadly articulated in the novel's organization of geographic space. On the one hand, the modern metropolis of London represents capitalism's emphasis on pragmatism and the accumulation of material wealth; on the other, the English countryside, accessible via King's Cross, fosters an idealism that values tradition, authentic personal connection, and the aesthetic --- what the novel calls \"the infinite.\" Based on the texts, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about King's Cross, as it is depicted in Text 1?",

    "questionText": "In Brazil, use of solid fuel (e.g., coal, wood) as a share of total household fuel use fell by around 70 percent between 2000 and 2019; such shifts are typically explained by appeal to the energy ladder, a model holding that fuel choice is mediated mainly by household income (specifically, high-technology fuels displace solid fuels as incomes rise). Alemu Mekonnen and Gunnar Kohlin's study of fuel use in Ethiopia shows this model to be reductive, however: household fuel use was heterogeneous, flexible, and influenced by several factors, including households' cooking habits. Based on the text, how would an advocate of the energy ladder model most likely explain the change observed in Brazil?",

Its very situation --- withdrawn a little behind the facile splendors of St. Pancras --- implied a comment on the materialism of life. Those two great arches, colorless, indifferent, shouldering between them an unlovely clock, were fit portals for some eternal adventure, whose issue might be prosperous, but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary language of prosperity. Text 2 The interplay between opposing ideological positions in Howards End is broadly articulated in the novel's organization of geographic space. On the one hand, the modern metropolis of London represents capitalism\u2019s emphasis on pragmatism and the accumulation of material wealth; on the other, the English countryside, accessible via King's Cross, fosters an idealism that values tradition, authentic personal connection, and the aesthetic --- what the novel calls \"the infinite.

    "questionText": "Born in Chile in 1917, artist and ethnomusicologist Violeta Parra was a pioneer in the nueva canci\u00f3n Chilean (Chilean New Song) movement that emerged in the late 1950s and then spread throughout Latin America, Portugal, and Spain as nueva canci\u00f3n. Parra traveled all over Chile compiling extensive records of authentic folk music as well as recipes, proverbs, and other facets of cultural history. These records formed the foundation for the early movement's revival of traditional Chilean folk forms in new songs that represented modern realities of the working class and strongly advocated for social change. As the movement spread beyond Chile, the breadth of musical traditions incorporated into its foundation also expanded. Which detail about songs associated with nueva canci\u00f3n, if true, would best illustrate the underlined claim?",

    "questionText": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) capitalize on the ability of some species of bacteria to metabolize metal, liberating electrons. The bacteria form a dense biofilm on the surface of an electron-collecting anode, but moving the electrons from the bacterial cytoplasm to an external electrode requires that the electrons pass through a series of inefficient oxidation --- reduction (redox) reacuons. Accordingly, MFC power output rarely exceeds a density of 0.30 milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm ). In an experiment, researchers added silver nanoparticles to carbon paper covering the anode in an MFC. The resulting power density was 0,66 mw/cm .
