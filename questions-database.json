    "questionText": "In some of his sculptures, Allan Houser uses abstract geometric shapes to depict his subjects rather than portraying them in realistic detail. For instance, his 1989 work Embrace is highly abstract and therefore differs strikingly from some of his other pieces in which the viewer can easily ______ familiar objects.",

Amos Barton.\" Mr. Ely is a clergyman in the town of Milby.\n\nBy the laity of Milby and its neighbourhood [Mr. Ely] was regarded as a man of quite remarkable powers and learning, who must make a considerable sensation in London pulpits and drawing-rooms on his occasional visit to the metropolis; and by his brother clergy he was regarded as a discreet and agreeable fellow. Mr. Ely never got into a warm discussion; he suggested what might be thought, but rarely said what he thought himself; he never let either men or women see that he was laughing at them, and he never gave any one an opportunity of laughing at him.",

Meanwhile, Patricia J. Wittkopp and colleagues have investigated how convergence occurs through different genetic mechanisms, but the relative prevalence of convergence through shared and different genetic processes is still poorly understood. This motivated biologists Delbert A.Green ll and Cassandra G. Extavour to evaluate both types of convergence in a single study for their 2012 paper.",

Occasionally I was ready for them: very often I wasn't. Never, however, was I so aware of entering a new stage as I was that afternoon in October when I finally dared to cross the threshold and my steps sounded hollowly in the unfurnished apartment. Behind me was a complicated past, and in front of me, like an omen, l could see a space opening out, a great empty space that time would take care of filling up.",

    "questionText": "In Brazil, use of solid fuel (e.g., coal, wood) as a share of total household fuel use fell by around 70 percent between 2000 and 2019; such shifts are typically explained by appeal to the energy ladder, a model holding that fuel choice is mediated mainly by household income (specifically, high-technology fuels displace solid fuels as incomes rise). Alemu Mekonnen and Gunnar Kohlin's study of fuel use in Ethiopia shows this model to be reductive, however: household fuel use was heterogeneous, flexible, and influenced by several factors, including households' cooking habits.",
    "prompt": "Based on the text, how would an advocate of the energy ladder model most likely explain the change observed in Brazil?",
    "choices": ["Between 2000 and 2019, household incomes rose in Brazil. resulting in households meeting a greater proportion of their fuel needs with high-technology fuels.", "Beginning in 2000, high-technology fuels became more readily available in Brazil, enabling households of various income levels to shift away from solid fuels", "Solid fuel use declined in Brazil between 2000 and 2019 because changes in household income during that period made solid fuels more expensive relative to income.", "Household incomes in Brazil rose from 2000 to 2019, which weakened the association between income and household fuel choice."],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The energy ladder model holds that 'high-technology fuels displace solid fuels as incomes rise.' An advocate would explain Brazil's shift away from solid fuels as a result of rising household incomes leading to greater use of high-technology fuels.",

Computer models have determined that for potential hycean planets, the range of the habitable zone(HZ), the distance from a star that allows a planet to retain liquid water on its surface, begins at about 1 astronomical unit (AU). In 2021, Nikku Madhusudhan et al. identified K2-18b as a hycean candidate, noting that the planet is located right on the inner edge of the HZ\n\nText 2\n\nIn a 2023 paper, Shang-Min 'Tsai et al. claimed that the hydrogen-rich atmospheres of K2-18b and other hycean candidates admit wavelengths of light that cause elevated surface temperatures and increased water evaporation. Unlike earlier assessments, Tsai et al.'s calculations therefore placed the inner edge for these planets' HZ as far out as 3.85 AU.",

Historically, eelgrass has been predominant, but widgeon grass is proving better suited torecent increases in sea temperature, tolerating heat better and growing faster than eelgrass does. Although the increase in widgeon grass has been associated with a substantial increase in total seagrass coverage in the bay, researchers caution that the latter change does not necessarily make the seagrass ecosystem as a whole more resilient to environmental shocks.",

    "prompt": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support the text's claim about wireless communication devices?",
    "choices": ["The near-constant kinetic vibration of a spacecraft makes it possible to power its wireless communication devices using only non-CFRP piezoelectric harvesters", "Intermittent or unpredictable electrical supply undermines the efficacy of wireless communication devices.", "The CFRP electrode is incompatible with most wireless communication devices", "The high conductivity of the CFRP is what makes the energy output from a piezoelectric harvester sufficient for wireless communication devices"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The text states that 'steady energy loads' are an 'absolute prerequisite' for powering wireless devices. Choice B supports this by explaining why steady supply is necessary.",

    "questionText": "Consumers increasingly expect that goods they purchase online will be delivered rapidly, even as soon as the day of purchase. Although efficiencies in long-distance transport of parcels have greatly improved delivery times, last-mile logistics (the final step in deliver to consumers) present a bottleneck for delivery companies. Time pressure resulting from consumer expectations is not the only challenge: other obstacles, such as the increasing congestion of roadways, persist. While innovations to mitigate these challenges have been emerging --- the use of aerial drones, for instance --- success has been constrained due to the additional complications that arise (e.g.. a lack of suitable drone landing sites in residential areas). Consequently, ______",

    "questionText": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) capitalize on the ability of some species of bacteria to metabolize metal, liberating electrons. The bacteria form a dense biofilm on the surface of an electron-collecting anode, but moving the electrons from the bacterial cytoplasm to an external electrode requires that the electrons pass through a series of inefficient oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. Accordingly, MFC power output rarely exceeds a density of 0.30 miliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2). In an experiment, researchers added silver nanoparticles to carbon paper covering the anode in an MFC. The resulting power density was 0.66 mW/cm2. Since metals such as silver exhibit high electrical conductivity, the researchers hypothesized that ______",
    "prompt": "Which choice most logically completes the text?",
    "choices": ["silver nanoparticles may increase the metabolic processes of the bacteria, thereby increasing the number of free electrons available to transfer to the electrode.", "as the density of the biofilm increases, the series of redox reactions may accelerate independent of the presence of the silver nanoparticles", "electrons may be conducted directly to the electrode before the silver nanoparticles catalyze the redox reactions.", "silver nanoparticles may allow electrons to bypass the series of redox reactions and transfer directly to the electrode"],
    "correctAnswer": 3,

For Titan, Saturn's largest moon, the observational data that exist are too sparse and discrepant to fully constrain the range of the methane mole fraction at various atmospheric levels. Juan Lora and colleagues point out that outputs of the IPSL atmospheric model of Titan, which track closely to observations in some respects reflect how the model's developers responded to this challenge: by prescribing a uniform methane mole fraction for the lowest level of the atmosphere. It is therefore important to note that ______",
